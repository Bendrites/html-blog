                    <p>Historians differ on exactly when Laozi lived and taught, but it’s largely held that some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the “old master” founded philosophical Taoism. 
                        Viewed as a divine figure in traditional Chinese religions, his ideas and writings would form one of the major pillars (alongside Confucius and the Buddha) for Eastern thought. 
                        Laozi espoused an ideal life lived through the Dao or Tao (roughly translated as “the way”). As such, Taoism is equally rooted in religion and philosophy. 
                        In traditional telling, though Laozi never opened a formal school, he worked as an archivist for the royal court of Zhou Dynasty. 
                        This gave him access to an extensive body of writing and artifacts, which he synthesized into his own poetry and prose. As a result of his writing, his influence spread widely during his lifetime. 
                        In fact, one version of his biography implies he may well have been a direct mentor to the Buddha (or, in some versions, was the Buddha himself). 
                        There are lot of colorful narratives surrounding Laozi, some of which are almost certainly myth. In fact, there are some historians who even question whether or not Laozi was a real person. 
                        Historical accounts differ on who he was, exactly when he lived and which works he contributed to the canon of Taoism. 
                        However, in most traditional tellings, Laozi was the living embodiment of the philosophy known as Taoism and author of its primary text, the Tao Te Ching.

                    <p>A necessary inclusion by virtue of his role as, essentially, the founder of Western Philosophy, Socrates is nonetheless unique among entrants on this list for having produced no written works reflecting his key ideas or principles. 
                        Thus, the body of his thoughts and ideas is left to be deciphered through the works of his two most prominent students, Plato and Xenophon, as well as to the legions of historians and critics who have written on him since. 
                        The classical Greek thinker is best known through Plato’s dialogues, which reveal a key contributor to the fields of ethics and education. 
                        And because Socrates is best known as a teacher of thought and insight, it is perhaps appropriate that his most widely recognized contribution is a way of approaching education that remains fundamentally relevant even today. 
                        The so-called Socratic Method, which involves the use of of questioning and discourse to promote open dialogue on complex topics and to lead pupils to their own insights, is on particular display in the Platonic dialogues. 
                        His inquisitive approach also positioned him as a central social and moral critic of the Athenian leadership, which ultimately led to his trial and execution for corrupting the minds of young Athenians.

                    <p class="dates">121 to 180 BCE</p>
                    <p>Marcus was an adherent of the Stoic school of philosophy. It was founded by Zeno of Citium (334 – 262 BC) and named after the Stoa in Athens where he and his students gathered. 
                        Among other ideas, Stoics believed that most events happen due to multiple interconnected causes outside of our power that they referred to as ‘fate.’ 
                        Some viewed this ‘fate’ as being under the control of a divinity that permeated the cosmos and called it ‘God’ or ‘Universal Reason.’ The key to happiness is to accept the will of ‘Universal Reason’ and ‘live in accord with nature.’

                    <h3>Thomas Aquinas</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="dates">1225 to 1274</p>
                    <p>Thomas Aquinas was a 13th century Dominican friar, theologian and Doctor of the Church, born in what is known today as the Lazio region of Italy. 
                        His most important contribution to Western thought is the concept of natural theology (sometimes referred to as Thomism in tribute to his influence). 
                        This belief system holds that the existence of God is verified through reason and rational explanation, as opposed to through scripture or religious experience. 
                        This ontological approach is among the central premises underpinning modern Catholic philosophy and liturgy. His writings, and Aquinas himself, are still considered among the preeminent models for Catholic priesthood. 
                        His ideas also remain central to theological debate, discourse, and modes of worship.

                    <p class="dates">1596 to 1650</p>
                    <p>A French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, Descartes was born in France but spent 20 years of his life in the Dutch Republic. 
                        As a member of the Dutch States Army, then as the Prince of Orange and subsequently as Stadtholder (a position of national leadership in the Dutch Republic), Descartes wielded considerable intellectual influence over the period known as the Dutch Golden Age. 
                        He often distinguished himself by refuting or attempting to undo the ideas of those that came before him.
